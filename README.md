# SCPdetection

This program detects change point(s) associated with explanatory variable(s) simultaneously using a permutation test. A simulated data example is introduced for illustration as follows: 
      -	Three variables are generated from Uniform distribution with sample size n=100.
      -	Only two change points associated with X1 and X1, each at 0.75.
      -	The permutation test is run for 10,000.
      -	The response variable follows the Poisson distribution.
