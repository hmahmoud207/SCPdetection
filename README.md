# SCPdetection

This program detects change points associated with explanatory variables simultaneously using a permutation test. A simulated data is generated for illustration. 
      -	Three variables are generated from Uniform distribution with sample size n=100.
      -	Only two change points associated with X1 and X1, each at 4.7.
      -	The permutation test is run for 10,000.
      -	The response variable follows the Poisson distribution.
